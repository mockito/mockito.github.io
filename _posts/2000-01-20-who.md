Mockito is served to you by **[Szczepan Faber](https://twitter.com/szczepiq) and friends**.
First engineers who were using Mockito in production were developers of the
[Guardian](http://guardian.co.uk/) project in London in early 2008.
Szczepan was lucky to be a part of the ThoughtWorks team assigned to the challenging and exciting Guardian project.
Here is how he explained why we needed [another mocking framework](http://monkeyisland.pl/2008/01/14/mockito)?

Hats down before **[EasyMock](http://easymock.org/) folks** for their ideas on beautiful and refactoring-friendly mocking API.
**First hacks on Mockito were done on top of the EasyMock code.**

Currently Mockito is maintained by [**Szczepan Faber**](https://twitter.com/szczepiq), [**Brice Dutheil**](https://twitter.com/BriceDutheil), [**Rafael Winterhalter**](https://twitter.com/rafaelcodes), [**Tim van der Lippe**](https://twitter.com/TimvdLippe), Marcin Grzejszczak, Marcin Zajączkowski and
a small [army of contributors](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/graphs/contributors).
Friends who contributed to Mockito (apologize if I missed somebody):
**Pascal Schumacher**, **Christian Schwartz**, **Igor Czechowski**, **Patric Fornasier**, **Jim Barritt**,
**Felix Leipold**, **Liz Keogh**, **Dan North**, **Bartosz Bańkowski**, **David Wallace**.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mockito/mockito) and [Bintray](https://bintray.com/szczepiq/maven/mockito/view) are used to facilitate continuous delivery.
Both tools are great. Thank you Travis, thank you Bintray!
