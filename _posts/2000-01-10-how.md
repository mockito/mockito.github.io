## How do I drink it?

Recommended way of getting Mockito is [declaring a dependency](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Declaring-mockito-dependency)
on "mockito-core" library using your favorite build system.
With [Gradle](http://gradle.org) one can do:

{% highlight Groovy %}
repositories { jcenter() }
dependencies { testImplementation "org.mockito:mockito-core:3.+" }
{% endhighlight %}

Maven users can declare a [dependency on mockito-core](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.mockito%20a:mockito-core).
Mockito publishes every change as a `-SNAPSHOT` version to a public [Sonatype repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-core).

Users doing manual dependency management can download the jars directly from 
[Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mockito/mockito-core/).

Legacy builds with manual dependency management can use the [1.* "mockito-all" distribution](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mockito/mockito-all/). Said distribution has been discontinued in Mockito 2.\*.

## now you can verify interactions

{% highlight Java %}
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

// mock creation
List mockedList = mock(List.class);

// using mock object - it does not throw any "unexpected interaction" exception
mockedList.add("one");
mockedList.clear();

// selective, explicit, highly readable verification
verify(mockedList).add("one");
verify(mockedList).clear();
{% endhighlight %}

## and stub method calls

{% highlight Java %}
// you can mock concrete classes, not only interfaces
LinkedList mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class);

// stubbing appears before the actual execution
when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first");

// the following prints "first"
System.out.println(mockedList.get(0));

// the following prints "null" because get(999) was not stubbed
System.out.println(mockedList.get(999));
{% endhighlight %}
