## How do I drink it?

Recommended way of getting Mockito is [declaring a dependency](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Declaring-mockito-dependency)
on "mockito-core" library using your favorite build system.
With [Gradle](http://gradle.org) one can do:

{% highlight Groovy %}
repositories { jcenter() }
dependencies { testCompile "org.mockito:mockito-core:2.+" }
{% endhighlight %}

Maven users can declare a [dependency on mockito-core](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.mockito%22%2C%20a%3A%22mockito-core%22).
Mockito is automatically published to [Bintray's jcenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/org/mockito/mockito-core)
and synced to the Maven Central Repository.

Legacy builds with manual dependency management can use 1.* "mockito-all" distribution.
It can be downloaded from Mockito's Bintray repository or Bintray's jcenter.
"mockito-all" distribution has been discontinued in Mockito 2.*.

## now you can verify interactions

{% highlight Java %}
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

// mock creation
List mockedList = mock(List.class);

// using mock object - it does not throw any "unexpected interaction" exception
mockedList.add("one");
mockedList.clear();

// selective, explicit, highly readable verification
verify(mockedList).add("one");
verify(mockedList).clear();
{% endhighlight %}

## and stub method calls

{% highlight Java %}
// you can mock concrete classes, not only interfaces
LinkedList mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class);

// stubbing appears before the actual execution
when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first");

// the following prints "first"
System.out.println(mockedList.get(0));

// the following prints "null" because get(999) was not stubbed
System.out.println(mockedList.get(999));
{% endhighlight %}
