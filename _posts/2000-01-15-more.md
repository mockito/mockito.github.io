## More info

[Main reference documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Mockito.html) features:

* [`mock()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Mockito.html#mock(T...))/[`@Mock`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Mock.html): create mock
     * optionally specify how it should behave via [`Answer`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/stubbing/Answer.html)/[`MockSettings`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/MockSettings.html)
     * [`when()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Mockito.html#when(T))/[`given()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/BDDMockito.html#given(java.lang.Object)) to specify how a mock should behave
     * If the provided answers don't fit your needs, write one yourself extending the [`Answer`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/stubbing/Answer.html) interface
* [`spy()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Mockito.html#spy(T))/[`@Spy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Spy.html):
  partial mocking, real methods are invoked but still can be verified and stubbed
* [`@InjectMocks`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/InjectMocks.html): automatically inject mocks/spies fields annotated with `@Spy` or `@Mock`
* [`verify()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Mockito.html#verify-T-): to check methods were called with given arguments
    * can use flexible argument matching, for example any expression via the [`any()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/ArgumentMatchers.html#any--)
    * or capture what arguments were called using [`@Captor`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/Captor.html) instead
* Try Behavior-Driven development syntax with [BDDMockito](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/org/mockito/BDDMockito.html)
* Use Mockito on Android, thanks to the team working on [dexmaker](https://github.com/crittercism/dexmaker)

## Remember

* Do not mock types you don't own
* Don't mock value objects
* Don't mock everything
* Show love with your tests!
