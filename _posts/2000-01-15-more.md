## More info

[Main reference documentation](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html) features:

* [`mock()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#mock(java.lang.Class))/[`@Mock`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mock.html): create mock
     * optionally specify how it should behave via [`Answer`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#field_summary)/[`ReturnValues`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/ReturnValues.html)/[`MockSettings`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/MockSettings.html)
     * [`when()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#when(T))/[`given()`](https://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/BDDMockito.html#given(T)) to specify how a mock should behave
     * If the provided answers don't fit your needs, write one yourself extending the [`Answer`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/stubbing/Answer.html) interface
* [`spy()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#spy(T))/[`@Spy`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Spy.html):
  partial mocking, real methods are invoked but still can be verified and stubbed
* [`@InjectMocks`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/InjectMocks.html): automatically inject mocks/spies fields annotated with `@Spy` or `@Mock`
* [`verify()`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Mockito.html#verify(T)): to check methods were called with given arguments
    * can use flexible argument matching, for example any expression via the [`any()`](https://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Matchers.html#any())
    * or capture what arguments where called using [`@Captor`](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/Captor.html) instead
* Try Behavior-Driven development syntax with [BDDMockito](http://mockito.github.io/mockito/docs/current/org/mockito/BDDMockito.html)
* Use Mockito on Android, thanks to the Google guys working on [dexmaker](https://code.google.com/p/dexmaker)

## Remember

* Do not mock types you don't own
* Don't mock value objects
* Don't mock everything
* Show love with your tests!
